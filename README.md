# **R_Chess**

## What is R_Chess ?

R_Chess is a simple chessboard that I have created for pure enjoyment and to test my own SDL2 wrapper, [sdlk](http://github.com/RickaPrincy/sdlk). I have designed it with my own unique algorithms.

## Old version (without sdlk)

You will find the old version of R_Chess (which I didnâ€™t have sdlk for yet) [OLD_VERSION](http://github.com/RickaPrincy/R_Chess/tree/old-version).

## What else ?

For now, you can only play against someone or against yourself on R_Chess. However, in the future, I plan to integrate [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish.git) into this program, and R_Chess will be able to be used as an analysis chessboard.
