# **R_Chess**

## What is R_Chess ?

R_Chess is a simple chessboard that I have created for pure enjoyment. I have designed it with my own unique algorithms.

## What else ?

For now, you can only play against someone or against yourself on R_Chess. However, in the future, I plan to integrate [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish.git) into this program, and R_Chess will be able to be used as an analysis chessboard.
